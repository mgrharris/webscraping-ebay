# webscraping-ebay
In this project, I web-scraped the President's day deals available from eBay's websites, extracted relevant information for each listing, and imported the data into a MySQL database for further analysis. 

This web-scraping project was completed on February 13th, 2021, and was completed individually. Noting that eBay's President Day Sales URL is no longer valid. 

The purpose of this project was to assist in making purchasing decisions by scraping item and user information for each listing. For analysis, I imported my results into my local MySQL instance, and queried information from my database.
